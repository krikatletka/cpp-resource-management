# cpp-resource-management
This is a learning project written in C++.

The goal of this project is to understand how manual memory management works in C++:
- dynamic allocation (`new` / `delete`)
- object lifetimes
- polymorphism
- virtual destructors
- deep copy and move semantics

The project is built step by step, starting from a simple base class.
